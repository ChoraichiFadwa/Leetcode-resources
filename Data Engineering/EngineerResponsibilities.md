12. How data engineers process data
03:19 - 04:38
In terms of data processing, data engineers have different responsibilities. They perform data manipulation, cleaning, and tidying tasks that can be automated, and that will always need to be done, regardless of the analysis anyone wants to do with them. For example, rejecting corrupt song files, or deciding what happens with missing metadata. What should we do when the genre is missing? Do we reject the file, do we leave the genre blank, or do we provide one by default? They also ensure that the data is stored in a sanely structured database, and create views on top of the database tables for easy access by analysts. Views are the output of a stored query on the data.
